Transaction: ACID
1x Database -> DB manages transaction
Flat Model -> Connection -> TX
begin/commit/rollback
Client-Server
Application: Connection-oriented

nx Database -> Distributed Transaction
Application manages the transaction -> Transaction Coordinator
Spring Boot automatically presents TC
TC runs 2PC (Two Phase Commit)
JDBC Driver should support 2PC -> XA Driver (DTX)

Saga Pattern -> DT -> BASE -> Eventual Consistent
